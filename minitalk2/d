Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone


CHAPTER ONE

THE BOY WHO LIVED

Mr and Mrs Dursley of number four Privet Drive were proud to say
that they were perfectly normal thank you very much They were the last
people youd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious
because they just didnt hold with such nonsense

Mr Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings which made
drills He was a big beefy man with hardly any neck although he did
have a very large mustache Mrs Dursley was thin and blonde and had
nearly twice the usual amount of neck which came in very useful as she
spent so much of her time craning over garden fences spying on the
neighbors The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their
opinion there was no finer boy anywhere

The Dursleys had everything they wanted but they also had a secret and
their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it They didnt
think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters Mrs
Potter was Mrs Dursleys sister but they hadnt met for several years;
in fact Mrs Dursley pretended she didnt have a sister because her
sister and her gofnothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was
possible to be The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would
say if the Potters arrived in the street The Dursleys knew that the
Potters had a small son too but they had never even seen him This boy
was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didnt want
Dudley mixing with a child like that

When Mr and Mrs Dursley woke up on the dull gray Tuesday our story
starts there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that
strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the
country Mr Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for
work and Mrs Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming
Dudley into his high chair

None of them noticed a large tawny owl flutter past the window

At half past eight Mr Dursley picked up his briefcase pecked Mrs
Dursley on the cheek and tried to kiss Dudley gobye but missed
because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the
walls 
Little tyke
 chortled Mr Dursley as he left the house He got
into his car and backed out of number fours drive

It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of
something peculia a cat reading a map For a second Mr Dursley
didnt realize what he had see then he jerked his head around to
look again There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet
Drive but there wasnt a map in sight What could he have been thinking
of? It must have been a trick of the light Mr Dursley blinked and
stared at the cat It stared back As Mr Dursley drove around the
corner and up the road he watched the cat in his mirror It was now
reading the sign that said Privet Driv no looking at the sign; cats
couldnt read maps or signs Mr Dursley gave himself a little shake and
put the cat out of his mind As he drove toward town he thought of
nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day

But on the edge of town drills were driven out of his mind by something
else As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam he couldnt help
noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people
about People in cloaks Mr Dursley couldnt bear people who dressed in
funny clothe the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this
was some stupid new fashion He drummed his fingers on the steering
wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite
close by They were whispering excitedly together Mr Dursley was
enraged to see that a couple of them werent young at all; why that man
had to be older than he was and wearing an emeragreen cloak! The
nerve of him! But then it struck Mr Dursley that this was probably some
silly stun these people were obviously collecting for something
yes that would be it The traffic moved on and a few minutes later Mr
Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot his mind back on drills

Mr Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the
ninth floor If he hadnt he might have found it harder to concentrate
on drills that morning He didnt see the owls swoop ing past in broad
daylight though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed
op mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead Most of them had never
seen an owl even at nighttime Mr Dursley however had a perfectly
normal ofree morning He yelled at five different people He made
several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more He was in a
very good mood until lunchtime when he thought hed stretch his legs
and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery

Hed forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of
them next to the bakers He eyed them angrily as he passed He didnt
know why but they made him uneasy This bunch were whispering
excitedly too and he couldnt see a single collecting tin It was on
his way back past them clutching a large doughnut in a bag that he
caught a few words of what they were saying


The Potters thats right thats what I heard yes their son Harry


Mr Dursley stopped dead Fear flooded him He looked back at the
whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them but thought better
of it

He dashed back across the road hurried up to his office snapped at his
secretary not to disturb him seized his telephone and had almost
finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind He put the
receiver back down and stroked his mustache thinking no he was
being stupid Potter wasnt such an unusual name He was sure there were
lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry Come to think
of it he wasnt even sure his nephew was called Harry Hed never even
seen the boy It might have been Harvey Or Harold There was no point
in worrying Mrs Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her
sister He didnt blame he if hed had a sister like that but all
the same those people in cloaks

He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and
when he left the building at five oclock he was still so worried that
he walked straight into someone just outside the door


Sorry
 he grunted as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell It
was a few seconds before Mr Dursley realized that the man was wearing a
violet cloak He didnt seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the
ground On the contrary his face split into a wide smile and he said in
a squeaky voice that made passersby stare 
Dont be sorry my dear sir
for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice for YKnWho has gone at
last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating this happy
happy day!


And the old man hugged Mr Dursley around the middle and walked off

Mr Dursley stood rooted to the spot He had been hugged by a complete
stranger He also thought he had been called a Muggle whatever that
was He was rattled He hurried to his car and set off for home hoping
he was imagining things which he had never hoped before because he
didnt approve of imagination

As he pulled into the driveway of number four the first thing he sa
and it didnt improve his moo was the tabby cat hed spotted that
morning It was now sitting on his garden wall He was sure it was the
same one; it had the same markings around its eyes


Shoo!
 said Mr Dursley loudly The cat didnt move It just gave him a
stern look Was this normal cat behavior? Mr Dursley wondered Trying
to pull himself together he let himself into the house He was still
determined not to mention anything to his wife

Mrs Dursley had had a nice normal day She told him over dinner all
about Mrs Next Doors problems with her daughter and how Dudley had
learned a new word (
	Wont!
) Mr Dursley tried to act normally When
Dudley had been put to bed he went into the living room in time to
catch the last report on the evening news:


And finally biwatchers everywhere have reported that the nations
owls have been behaving very unusually today Although owls normally
hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight there have been
hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since
sunrise Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly
changed their sleeping pattern
 The newscaster allowed himself a grin

Most mysterious And now over to Jim McGuffin with the weather Going
to be any more showers of owls tonight Jim?



Well Ted
 said the weatherman 
I dont know about that but its not
only the owls that have been acting oddly today Viewers as far apart as
Kent Yorkshire and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead
of the rain I promised yesterday theyve had a downpour of shooting
stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night earl its
not until next week folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight


Mr Dursley sat frozen in his armchair Shooting stars all over Britain?
Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place?
And a whisper a whisper about the Potters

Mrs Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea It was
no good Hed have to say something to her He cleared his throat
nervously 
E Petunia dea you havent heard from your sister
lately have you?


As he had expected Mrs Dursley looked shocked and angry After all
they normally pretended she didnt have a sister


No
 she said sharply 
Why?



Funny stuff on the news
 Mr Dursley mumbled 
Owls shooting
stars and there were a lot of funlooking people in town today



So?
 snapped Mrs Dursley


Well I just thought maybe it was something to do with you
know her crowd


Mrs Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips Mr Dursley wondered
whether he dared tell her hed heard the name 
Potter
 He decided he
didnt dare Instead he said as casually as he could 
Their so
hed be about Dudleys age now wouldnt he?



I suppose so
 said Mrs Dursley stiffly


Whats his name again? Howard isnt it?



Harry Nasty common name if you ask me



Oh yes
 said Mr Dursley his heart sinking horribly 
Yes I quite
agree


He didnt say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed
While Mrs Dursley was in the bathroom Mr Dursley crept to the bedroom
window and peered down into the front garden The cat was still there
It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for
something

Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the
Potters? If it did if it got out that they were related to a pair o well he didnt think he could bear it

The Dursleys got into bed Mrs Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr
Dursley lay awake turning it all over in his mind His last comforting
thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were
involved there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs
Dursley The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about
them and their kind He couldnt see how he and Petunia could get
mixed up in anything that might be going o he yawned and turned ove it couldnt affect them

How very wrong he was

Mr Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep but the cat
on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness It was sitting as
still as a statue its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of
Privet Drive It didnt so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the
next street nor when two owls swooped overhead In fact it was nearly
midnight before the cat moved at all

A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching appeared so
suddenly and silently youd have thought hed just popped out of the
ground The cats tail twitched and its eyes narrowed

Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive He was tall
thin and very old judging by the silver of his hair and beard which
were both long enough to tuck into his belt He was wearing long robes
a purple cloak that swept the ground and hiheeled buckled boots
His blue eyes were light bright and sparkling behind hamoon
spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked as though it had been
broken at least twice This mans name was Albus Dumbledore

Albus Dumbledore didnt seem to realize that he had just arrived in a
street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome He was
busy rummaging in his cloak looking for something But he did seem to
realize he was being watched because he looked up suddenly at the cat
which was still staring at him from the other end of the street For
some reason the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him He chuckled and
muttered 
I should have known


He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket It seemed to be a
silver cigarette lighter He flicked it open held it up in the air and
clicked it The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop He
clicked it agai the next lamp flickered into darkness Twelve times
he clicked the POuter until the only lights left on the whole street
were two tiny pinpricks in the distance which were the eyes of the cat
watching him If anyone looked out of their window now even beaeyed
Mrs Dursley they wouldnt be able to see anything that was happening
down on the pavement Dumbledore slipped the POuter back inside his
cloak and set off down the street toward number four where he sat down
on the wall next to the cat He didnt look at it but after a moment he
spoke to it


Fancy seeing you here Professor McGonagall


He turned to smile at the tabby but it had gone Instead he was smiling
at a rather sevelooking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly
the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes She too was
wearing a cloak an emerald one Her black hair was drawn into a tight
bun She looked distinctly ruffled


How did you know it was me?
 she asked


My dear Professor I ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly



Youd be stiff if youd been sitting on a brick wall all day
 said
Professor McGonagall


All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a
dozen feasts and parties on my way here


Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily


Oh yes everyones celebrating all right
 she said impatiently

Youd think theyd be a bit more careful but n even the Muggles
have noticed somethings going on It was on their news
 She jerked her
head back at the Dursleys dark liviroom window 
I heard it Flocks
of owls shooting stars Well theyre not completely stupid They
were bound to notice something Shooting stars down in Ken Ill bet
that was Dedalus Diggle He never had much sense



You cant blame them
 said Dumbledore gently 
Weve had precious
little to celebrate for eleven years



I know that
 said Professor McGonagall irritably 
But thats no
reason to lose our heads People are being downright careless out on
the streets in broad daylight not even dressed in Muggle clothes
swapping rumors


She threw a sharp sideways glance at Dumbledore here as though hoping
he was going to tell her something but he didnt so she went on 
A
fine thing it would be if on the very day YouKnWho seems to have
disappeared at last the Muggles found out about us all I suppose he
really has gone Dumbledore?



It certainly seems so
 said Dumbledore 
We have much to be thankful
for Would you care for a lemon drop?



A what?



A lemon drop Theyre a kind of Muggle sweet Im rather fond of



No thank you
 said Professor McGonagall coldly as though she didnt
think this was the moment for lemon drops 
As I say even if
YKnWho has gon



My dear Professor surely a sensible person like yourself can call him
by his name? All this Y KnWho nonsens for eleven years I
have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name:
Voldemort
 Professor McGonagall flinched but Dumbledore who was
unsticking two lemon drops seemed not to notice 
It all gets so
confusing if we keep saying YKnWho I have never seen any reason
to be frightened of saying Voldemorts name


I know you haven t said Professor McGonagall sounding half
exasperated half admiring 
But youre different Everyone knows youre
the only one YKn oh all right Voldemort was frightened of



You flatter me
 said Dumbledore calmly 
Voldemort had powers I will
never have



Only because youre to wel noble to use them



Its lucky its dark I havent blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey
told me she liked my new earmuffs


Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said 
The owls
are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around You know what
everyones saying? About why hes disappeared? About what finally
stopped him?


It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most
anxious to discuss the real reason she had been waiting on a cold hard
wall all day for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed
Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now It was plain that
whatever 
everyone
 was saying she was not going to believe it until
Dumbledore told her it was true Dumbledore however was choosing
another lemon drop and did not answer


What theyre saying
 she pressed on 
is that last night Voldemort
turned up in Godrics Hollow He went to find the Potters The rumor is
that Lily and James Potter ar ar that theyr dead 


Dumbledore bowed his head Professor McGonagall gasped


Lily and James I cant believe it I didnt want to believe it
Oh Albus


Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder 
I know I
know
 he said heavily

Professor McGonagalls voice trembled as she went on 
Thats not all
Theyre saying he tried to kill the Potters son Harry Bu he
couldnt He couldnt kill that little boy No one knows why or how
but theyre saying that when he couldnt kill Harry Potter Voldemorts
power somehow brok and thats why hes gone

Dumbledore nodded glumly


It its true?
 faltered Professor McGonagall 
After all hes
done all the people hes killed he couldnt kill a little boy?
Its just astounding of all the things to stop him but how in the
name of heaven did Harry survive?



We can only guess
 said Dumbledore 
We may never know


Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her
eyes beneath her spectacles Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a
golden watch from his pocket and examined it It was a very odd watch
It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead little planets were moving
around the edge It must have made sense to Dumbledore though because
he put it back in his pocket and said 
Hagrids late I suppose it was
he who told you Id be here by the way?



Yes
 said Professor McGonagall 
And I dont suppose youre going to
tell me why youre here of all places?



Ive come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle Theyre the only family
he has left now



You dont mea you cant mean the people who live here?
 cried
Professor McGonagall jumping to her feet and pointing at number four

Dumbledor you cant Ive been watching them all day You couldnt
find two people who are less like us And theyve got this so I saw
him kicking his mother all the way up the street screaming for sweets
Harry Potter come and live here!



Its the best place for him
 said Dumbledore firmly 
His aunt and
uncle will be able to explain everything to him when hes older Ive
written them a letter



A letter?
 repeated Professor McGonagall faintly sitting back down on
the wall 
Really Dumbledore you think you can explain all this in a
letter? These people will never understand him! Hell be famou a
legen I wouldnt be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day
in the futur there will be books written about Harr every child
in our world will know his name!



Exactly
 said Dumbledore looking very seriously over the top of his
hamoon glasses 
It would be enough to turn any boys head Famous
before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he wont even
remember! CarA you see how much better off hell be growing up away
from all that until hes ready to take it?


Professor McGonagall opened her mouth changed her mind swallowed and
then said 
Ye yes youre right of course But how is the boy
getting here Dumbledore?
 She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she
thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it


Hagrids bringing him



You think i wis to trust Hagrid with something as important as
this?


I would trust Hagrid with my life
 said Dumbledore


Im not saying his heart isnt in the right place
 said Professor
McGonagall grudgingly 
but you cant pretend hes not careless He does
tend t what was that?


A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them It grew
steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a
headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sk and
a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of
them

If the motorcycle was huge it was nothing to the man sitting astride
it He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times
as wide He looked simply too big to be allowed and so wil long
tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face he had hands
the size of trash can lids and his feet in their leather boots were
like baby dolphins In his vast muscular arms he was holding a bundle
of blankets


Hagrid
 said Dumbledore sounding relieved 
At last And where did
you get that motorcycle?



Borrowed it Professor Dumbledore sit
 said the giant climbing
carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke 
Young Sirius Black lent it to
me Ive got him sir



No problems were there?



No si house was almost destroyed but I got him out all right
before the Muggles started swarmin around He fell asleep as we was
flyin over Bristol


Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of
blankets Inside just visible was a baby boy fast asleep Under a
tuft of jblack hair over his forehead they could see a curiously
shaped cut like a bolt of lightning


Is that wher?
 whispered Professor McGonagall


Yes
 said Dumbledore 
Hell have that scar forever



Couldnt you do something about it Dumbledore?



Even if I could I wouldnt Scars can come in handy I have one myself
above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground Wel give him here Hagri wed better get this over with


Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys house


Could  could I say gobye to him sir?
 asked Hagrid He bent his
great shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very
scratchy whiskery kiss Then suddenly Hagrid let out a howl like a
wounded dog


Shhh!
 hissed Professor McGonagall 
youll wake the Muggles!


sorry
 sobbed Hagrid taking out a large spotted handkerchief and
burying his face in it 
But Icant stand i Lily an James dea an poor little Harry off ter live with Muggle



Yes yes its all very sad but get a grip on yourself Hagrid or
well be found
 Professor McGonagall whispered patting Hagrid gingerly
on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to
the front door He laid Harry gently on the doorstep took a letter out
of his cloak tucked it inside Harrys blankets and then came back to
the other two For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at
the little bundle; Hagrids shoulders shook Professor McGonagall
blinked furiously and the twinkling light that usually shone from
Dumbledores eyes seemed to have gone out


Well
 said Dumbledore finally 
thats that Weve no business staying
here We may as well go and join the celebrations



Yeah
 said Hagrid in a very muffled voice 
Ill be takin Sirius his
bike back Gnight Professor McGonagal Professor Dumbledore sir


Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve Hagrid swung himself
onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose
into the air and off into the night


I shall see you soon I expect Professor McGonagall
 said Dumbledore
nodding to her Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply

Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street On the corner he
stopped and took out the silver POuter He clicked it once and
twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet
Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking
around the corner at the other end of the street He could just see the
bundle of blankets on the step of number four


Good luck Harry
 he murmured He turned on his heel and with a swish
of his cloak he was gone

A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive which lay silent and
tidy under the inky sky the very last place you would expect
astonishing things to happen Harry Potter rolled over inside his
blankets without waking up One small hand closed on the letter beside
him and he slept on not knowing he was special not knowing he was
famous not knowing he would be woken in a few hours time by Mrs
Dursleys scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk
bottles nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and
pinched by his cousin Dudley He couldnt know that at this very
moment people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up
their glasses and saying in hushed voices: 
To Harry Potte the boy
who lived!



CHAPTER TWO

THE VANISHING GLASS

Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find
their nephew on the front step but Privet Drive had hardly changed at
all The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass
number four on the Dursleys front door; it crept into their living
room which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when
Mr Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls Only the
photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed
Ten years ago there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a
large pink beach ball wearing differecolored bonnet but Dudley
Dursley was no longer a baby and now the photographs showed a large
blond boy riding his first bicycle on a carousel at the fair playing a
computer game with his father being hugged and kissed by his mother
The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house too

Yet Harry Potter was still there asleep at the moment but not for
long His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made
the first noise of the day


Up! Get up! Now!


Harry woke with a start His aunt rapped on the door again


Up!
 she screeched Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then
the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove He rolled onto his
back and tried to remember the dream he had been having It had been a
good one There had been a flying motorcycle in it He had a funny
feeling hed had the same dream before

His aunt was back outside the door


Are you up yet?
 she demanded


Nearly
 said Harry


Well get a move on I want you to look after the bacon And dont you
dare let it burn I want everything perfect on Duddys birthday


Harry groaned


What did you say?
 his aunt snapped through the door


Nothing nothing


Dudleys birthda how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out
of bed and started looking for socks He found a pair under his bed and
after pulling a spider off one of them put them on Harry was used to
spiders because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them and
that was where he slept

When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen The table
was almost hidden beneath all Dudleys birthday presents It looked as
though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted not to mention the
second television and the racing bike Exactly why Dudley wanted a
racing bike was a mystery to Harry as Dudley was very fat and hated
exercis unless of course it involved punching somebody Dudleys
favorite punching bag was Harry but he couldnt often catch him Harry
didnt look it but he was very fast

Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard but Harry
had always been small and skinny for his age He looked even smaller and
skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes
of Dudleys and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was Harry
had a thin face knobbly knees black hair and bright green eyes He
wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of
all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose The only thing Harry
liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that
was shaped like a bolt of lightning He had had it as long as he could
remember and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt
Petunia was how he had gotten it


In the car crash when your parents died
 she had said 
And dont ask
questions


Dont ask question that was the first rule for a quiet life with the
Dursleys

Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon


Comb your hair!
 he barked by way of a morning greeting

About once a week Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and
shouted that Harry needed a haircut Harry must have had more haircuts
than the rest of the boys in his class put

together but it made no difference his hair simply grew that wa
all over the place

Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his
mother Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon He had a large pink face
not much neck small watery blue eyes and thick blond hair that lay
smoothly on his thick fat head Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley
looked like a baby ange Harry often said that Dudley looked like a
pig in a wig

Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table which was difficult
as there wasnt much room Dudley meanwhile was counting his presents
His face fell


Thirsix
 he said looking up at his mother and father 
Thats two
less than last year



Darling you havent counted Auntie Marges present see its here
under this big one from Mommy and Daddy



All right thirseven then
 said Dudley going red in the face
Harry who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on began wolfing down
his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over

Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger too because she said quickly

And well buy you another two presents while were out today Hows
that popkin? Two more presents Is that all right

Dudley thought for a moment It looked like hard work Finally he said
slowly 
So Ill have thirty  thirty



Thirnine sweetums
 said Aunt Petunia


Oh
 Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel 
All right
then


Uncle Vernon chuckled 
Little tyke wants his moneys worth just like
his father Atta boy Dudley!
 He ruffled Dudleys hair

At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it
while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike a
video camera a remote control airplane sixteen new computer games and
a VCR He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia
came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried


Bad news Vernon
 she said 
Mrs Figgs broken her leg She cant
take him
 She jerked her head in Harrys direction

Dudleys mouth fell open in horror but Harrys heart gave a leap Every
year on Dudleys birthday his parents took him and a friend out for the
day to adventure parks hamburger restaurants or the movies Every
year Harry was left behind with Mrs Figg a mad old lady who lived two
streets away Harry hated it there The whole house smelled of cabbage
and Mrs Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats shed ever
owned


Now what?
 said Aunt Petunia looking furiously at Harry as though hed
planned this Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs Figg had
broken her leg but it wasnt easy when he reminded himself it would be
a whole year before he had to look at Tibbles Snowy Mr Paws and
Tufty again


We could phone Marge
 Uncle Vernon suggested


Dont be silly Vernon she hates the boy


The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this as though he wasnt
ther or rather as though he was something very nasty that couldnt
understand them like a slug


What about whathname your frien Yvonne?



On vacation in Majorca
 snapped Aunt Petunia


You could just leave me here
 Harry put in hopefully (hed be able to
watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go
on Dudleys computer)

Aunt Petunia looked as though shed just swallowed a lemon


And come back and find the house in ruins?
 she snarled


I wont blow up the house
 said Harry but they werent listening


I suppose we could take him to the zoo
 said Aunt Petunia slowly 

and leave him in the car



That cars new hes not sitting in it alone


Dudley began to cry loudly In fact he wasnt really cryin it had
been years since hed really crie but he knew that if he screwed up
his face and wailed his mother would give him anything he wanted


Dinky Duddydums dont cry Mummy wont let him spoil your special
day!
 she cried flinging her arms around him


I dont want himto come!
 Dudley yelled between huge
pretend sobs 
He always  spoils everything!
 He shot Harry a nasty
grin through the gap in his mothers arms

Just then the doorbell ran 
Oh good Lord theyre here!
 said Aunt
Petunia franticall and a moment later Dudleys best friend Piers
Polkiss walked in with his mother Piers was a scrawny boy with a face
like a rat He was usually the one who held peoples arms behind their
backs while Dudley hit them Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once

Half an hour later Harry who couldnt believe his luck was sitting in
the back of the Dursleys car with Piers and Dudley on the way to the
zoo for the first time in his life His aunt and uncle hadnt been able
to think of anything else to do with him but before theyd left Uncle
Vernon had taken Harry aside


Im warning you
 he had said putting his large purple face right up
close to Harrys 
Im warning you now bo any funny business
anything at al and youll be in that cupboard from now until
Christmas



Im not going to do anything
 said Harry 
honestly

But Uncle Vernon didnt believe him No one ever did

The problem was strange things often happened around Harry and it was
just no good telling the Dursleys he didnt make them happen

Once Aunt Petunia tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking
as though he hadnt been at all had taken a pair of kitchen scissors
and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs which
she left 
to hide that horrible scar
 Dudley had laughed himself silly
at Harry who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day
where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses
Next morning however he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it
had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off He had been given a week
in his cupboard for this even though he had tried to explain that he
couldnt explain how it had grown back so quickly

Another time Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting
old sweater of Dudleys (brown with orange puff balls The harder she
tried to pull it over his head the smaller it seemed to become until
finally it might have fitted a hand puppet but certainly wouldnt fit
Harry Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and to
his great relief Harry wasnt punished

On the other hand hed gotten into terrible trouble for being found on
the roof of the school kitchens Dudleys gang had been chasing him as
usual when as much to Harrys surprise as anyone elses there he was
sitting on the chimney The Dursleys had received a very angry letter
from Harrys headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school
buildings But all hed tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon
through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash
cans outside the kitchen doors Harry supposed that the wind must have
caught him in m jump

But today nothing was going to go wrong It was even worth being with
Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasnt school
his cupboard or Mrs Figgs cabbasmelling living room

While he drove Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia He liked to
complain about things: people at work Harry the council Harry the
bank and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects This morning
it was motorcycles


 roaring along like maniacs the young hoodlums
 he said as a
motorcycle overtook them

I had a dream about a motorcycle
 said Harry remembering suddenly 
It
was flying


Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front He turned right
around in his seat and yelled at Harry his face like a gigantic beet
with a mustache: 
MOTORCYCLES DONT FLY!


Dudley and Piers sniggered

I know they dont
 said Harry 
It was only a dream


But he wished he hadnt said anything If there was one thing the
Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions it was his talking
about anything acting in a way it shouldnt no matter if it was in a
dream or even a cartoo they seemed to think he might get dangerous
ideas

It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families The
Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the
entrance and then because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry
what he wanted before they could hurry him away they bought him a cheap
lemon ice pop It wasnt bad either Harry thought licking it as they
watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley
except that it wasnt blond

Harry had the best morning hed had in a long time He was careful to
walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers who
were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime wouldnt fall
back on their favorite hobby of hitting him They ate in the zoo
restaurant and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker
glory didnt have enough ice cream on top Uncle Vernon bought him
another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first

Harry felt afterward that he should have known it was all too good to
last

After lunch they went to the reptile house It was cool and dark in
there with lit windows all along the walls Behind the glass all sorts
of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and
stone Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge poisonous cobras and thick
mcrushing pythons Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the
place It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernons car
and crushed it into a trash ca but at the moment it didnt look in
the mood In fact it was fast asleep

Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass staring at the
glistening brown coils


Make it move
 he whined at his father Uncle Vernon tapped on the
glass but the snake didnt budge


Do it again
 Dudley ordered Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly
with his knuckles but the snake just snoozed on


This is boring
 Dudley moaned He shuffled away

Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake He
wouldnt have been surprised if it had died of boredom itsel no
company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying
to disturb it all day long It was worse than having a cupboard as a
bedroom where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door
to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house

The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes Slowly very slowly it raised
its head until its eyes were on a level with Harrys

It winked

Harry stared Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was
watching They werent He looked back at the snake and winked too

The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley then raised
its eyes to the ceiling It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly:


I get that all the time


I know
 Harry murmured through the glass though he wasnt sure the
snake could hear him 
It must be really annoying


The snake nodded vigorously


Where do you come from anyway?
 Harry asked

The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass Harry
peered at it

Boa Constrictor Brazil


Was it nice there?


The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on:
This specimen was bred in the zoo 
Oh I se so youve never been to
Brazil?


As the snake shook its head a deafening shout behind Harry made both of
them jump


DUDLEY! MR DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WONT BELIEVE
WHAT ITS DOING!


Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could


Out of the way you
 he said punching Harry in the ribs Caught by
surprise Harry fell hard on the concrete floor What came next happened
so fast no one saw how it happene one second Piers and Dudley were
leaning right up close to the glass the next they had leapt back with
howls of horror

Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictors tank
had vanished The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly slithering
out onto the floor People throughout the reptile house screamed and
started running for the exits

As the snake slid swiftly past him Harry could have sworn a low
hissing voice said 
Brazil here I come Thanksss amigo


The keeper of the reptile house was in shock


But the glass
 he kept saying 
where did the glass go?


The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong sweet tea
while he apologized over and over again Piers and Dudley could only
gibber As far as Harry had seen the snake hadnt done anything except
snap playfully at their heels as it passed but by the time they were
all back in Uncle Vernons car Dudley was telling them how it had
nearly bitten off his leg while Piers was swearing it had tried to
squeeze him to death But worst of all for Harry at least was Piers
calming down enough to say 
Harry was talking to it werent you
Harry?


Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before
starting on Harry He was so angry he could hardly speak He managed to
say 
G cupboar sta no meals
 before he collapsed into a
chair and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy

Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later wishing he had a watch He
didnt know what time it was and he couldnt be sure the Dursleys were
asleep yet Until they were he couldnt risk sneaking to the kitchen
for some food

Hed lived with the Dursleys almost ten years ten miserable years as
long as he could remember ever since hed been a baby and his parents
had died in that car crash He couldnt remember being in the car when
his parents had died Sometimes when he strained his memory during long
hours in his cupboard he came up with a strange vision: a blinding
flash of green light and a bu ing pain on his forehead This he
supposed was the crash though he couldnt imagine where all the green
light came from He couldnt remember his parents at all His aunt and
uncle never spoke about them and of course he was forbidden to ask
questions There were no photographs of them in the house

When he had been younger Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown
relation coming to take him away but it had never happened; the
Dursleys were his only family Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped)
that strangers in the street seemed to know him Very strange strangers
they were too A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once
while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley After asking Harry
furiously if he knew the man Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the
shop without buying anything A wilooking old woman dressed all in
green had waved merrily at him once on a bus A bald man in a very long
purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and
then walked away without a word The weirdest thing about all these
people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a
closer look

At school Harry had no one Everybody knew that Dudleys gang hated
that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses and
nobody liked to disagree with Dudleys gang


CHAPTER THREE

THE LETTERS FROM NO ONE

The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his
longeever punishment By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard
again the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his
new video camera crashed his remote control airplane and first time
out on his racing bike knocked down old Mrs Figg as she crossed Privet
Drive on her crutches

Harry was glad school was over but there was no escaping Dudleys gang
who visited the house every single day Piers Dennis Malcolm and
Gordon were all big and stupid but as Dudley was the biggest and
stupidest of the lot he was the leader The rest of them were all quite
happy to join in Dudleys favorite sport: Harry Hunting

This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house
wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays where he
could see a tiny ray of hope When September came he would be going off
to secondary school and for the first time in his life he wouldnt be
with Dudley Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernons old private
school Smeltings Piers Polkiss was going there too Harry on the
other hand was going to Stonewall High the local public school Dudley
thought this was very funny


They stuff peoples heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall

he told Harry 
Want to come upstairs and practice?



No thanks
 said Harry 
The poor toilets never had anything as
horrible as your head down i it might be sick
 Then he ran before
Dudley could work out what hed said

One day in July Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings
uniform leaving Harry at Mrs Figgs Mrs Figg wasn t as bad as
usual It turned out shed broken her leg tripping over one of her cats
and she didnt seem quite as fond of them as before She let Harry watch
television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though
shed had it for several years

That evening Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in
his branew uniform Smeltings boys wore maroon tailcoats orange
knickerbockers and flat straw hats called boaters They also carried
knobbly sticks used for hitting each other while the teachers werent
looking This was supposed to be good training for later life

As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers Uncle Vernon said
gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life Aunt Petunia burst
into tears and said she couldnt believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins he
looked so handsome and group Harry didnt trust himself to speak He
thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to
laugh

There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry
went in for breakfast It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in
the sink He went to have a look The tub was full of what looked like
dirty rags swimming in gray water


Whats this?
 he asked Aunt Petunia Her lips tightened as they always
did if he dared to ask a question


Your new school uniform
 she said

Harry looked in the bowl again


Oh
 he said 
I didnt realize it had to be so wet



DotA be stupid
 snapped Aunt Petunia 
Im dyeing some of Dudleys old
things gray for you Itll look just like everyone elses when Ive
finished


Harry seriously doubted this but thought it best not to argue He sat
down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look
on his first day at Stonewall Hig like he was wearing bits of old
elephant skin probably

Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in both with wrinkled noses because of the
smell from Harrys new uniform Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as
usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick which he carried everywhere
on the table

They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the
doormat


Get the mail Dudley
 said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper


Make Harry get it



Get the mail Harry



Make Dudley get it



Poke him with your Smelting stick Dudley


Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail Three things
lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernons sister Marge who was
vacationing on the Isle of Wight a brown envelope that looked like a
bill an a letter for Harry

Harry picked it up and stared at it his heart twanging like a giant
elastic band No one ever in his whole life had written to him Who
would? He had no friends no other relative he didnt belong to the
library so hed never even got rude notes asking for books back Yet
here it was a letter addressed so plainly there could be no mistake:

Mr H Potter

The Cupboard under the Stairs

4 Privet Drive

Little Whinging

Surrey

The envelope was thick and heavy made of yellowish parchment and the
address was written in emeragreen ink There was no stamp

Turning the envelope over his hand trembling Harry saw a purple wax
seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion an eagle a badger and a snake
surrounding a large letter H


Hurry up boy!
 shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen 
What are you
doing checking for letter bombs?
 He chuckled at his own joke

Harry went back to the kitchen still staring at his letter He handed
Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard sat down and slowly began to
open the yellow envelope

Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill snorted in disgust and flipped over
the postcard


Marges ill
 he informed Aunt Petunia 
Ate a funny whelk



Dad!
 said Dudley suddenly 
Dad Harrys got something!


Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter which was written on the
same heavy parchment as the envelope when it was jerked sharply out of
his hand by Uncle Vernon


Thats mine!
 said Harry trying to snatch it back


Whod be writing to you?
 sneered Uncle Vernon shaking the letter open
with one hand and glancing at it His face went from red to green faster
than a set of traffic lights And it didnt stop there Within seconds
it was the grayish white of old porridge

Petunia!
 he gasped

Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it but Uncle Vernon held it
high out of his reach Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first
line For a moment it looked as though she might faint She clutched her
throat and made a choking noise


Vernon! Oh my goodnes Vernon!


They stared at each other seeming to have forgotten that Harry and
Dudley were still in the room Dudley wasnt used to being ignored He
gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick


I want to read that letter
 he said loudly want to read it
 said
Harry furiously 
as its mine



Get out both of you
 croaked Uncle Vernon stuffing the letter back
inside its envelope

Harry didnt move

I WANT MY LETTER!
 he shouted


Let me see it!
 demanded Dudley


OUT!
 roared Uncle Vernon and he took both Harry and Dudley by the
scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall slamming the
kitchen door behind them Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but
silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won so Harry
his glasses dangling from one ear lay flat on his stomach to listen at
the crack between door and floor
